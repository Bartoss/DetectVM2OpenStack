Detect VM and installed software in OpenStack
# VirtualMachinesAndInstalledSoftwareFinder
The goal of the project is to create a tool to discover and collect information about the VMs and software. In addition to that, one should develop a web-based dashboard (any modern Web UI technology) that would list all the virtual machines (I use Spring with Bootstrap and JavaScript).
